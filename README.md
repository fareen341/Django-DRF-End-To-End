# Django ORM
1. Group By: Get count of views by views, meaning group by using views:
<pre>
  #group by only views:
  queryset = Blog.objects.values('views').annotate(view_count=Count('views'))

  #group by name and views, whatever we put in values() that becomes group by
  queryset = Blog.objects.values('views', 'name').annotate(view_count=Count('views'))
</pre>

2. Join: all(), select_related(), prefetch_related()
<pre>
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    bio = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # publication_date = models.DateField()
    version = models.CharField(max_length=13)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Price(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE, default=0.0)
    price = models.IntegerField()
</pre>

<pre>
So the difference in prefetch_related is select_related is:
1. prefetch_related is used when you have to get data from reverse foreign key eg: author and book, book has foreign key and 
  i want to fetch records from author table then i can use prefetch_related. Eg: Book.objects.prefetch_related('price_set')
2. select_related is used when we wants to fetch records from the foreign key table i.e from book table. Eg: Book.objects.select_related('author')
3. consider below query:
    x = Book.objects.all().values('title', 'author__name')
    x = Book.objects.select_related('author').values('title', 'author__name')

both will print the same query:
SELECT "BlogApp_book"."title", "BlogApp_author"."name" FROM "BlogApp_book" INNER JOIN "BlogApp_author" ON ("BlogApp_book"."author_id" = "BlogApp_author"."id")

But the main difference is, when we hit first query it'll run the query again and again even tho it is join it'll do the join again and again, 
  but in second query it'll do the join once and store the result in the memory

4. use of both select_related & prefetch_related
Eg: for this eg consider the below models.
Book.objects.select_related('author').prefetch_related('price_set')
1. In above example, i can go from price to book but not vice versa, if i want vise versa then i can use prefetch_related. So in above example 
  author is part of Book, but i cant see price field name in book itself thats is why here comes the reverse foreign key.
2. in prefetch_related i can use _set or i can give the name in model field itself, which is related_name = "price
